      <p>WHAT MADE US FALL <br>IN LOVE WITH CHESS</p>
      <div class="answer">
        During the peak of the Covid lockdown, as teenagers, we found ourselves spending countless hours online,
        engrossed in the world of chess. It was only during this time that we stumbled upon the captivating chess boom
        commonly known as the "Samay Raina Chess Boom" featuring the renowned stand-up comedian and International
        Master, Sagar Shah. The electrifying combination of their comedy and expertise brought chess to life in an
        entirely new way. We were captivated by the game's strategic depth, intellectual challenge, and the sense of
        community it fostered<br>
